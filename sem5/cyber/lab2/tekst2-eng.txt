The emperor combed the empress's hair, the empress combed the emperor's hair. On a rainy morning, the yellowtails and freckles, instead of taking on earthworms, gorged themselves on cress pulp on an empty stomach and vomited in a row into a red-hot roasting pan.

A little boy lived in the block for a year, who had a curl. He really wanted to cut that curl. A year passed, but he still had the curl. King Charles bought Queen Caroline coral-colored beads. George is lying on the tower and can't believe that his hair is standing on end from the squeaking of bats. My mother has a mummy. On a revolver hill, next to a revolver gunman, lies a revolver of a revolver gunman. A certain insatiable glutton once got hungry for more than a joke.
